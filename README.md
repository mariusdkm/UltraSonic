3d pathing is now possible;

## Usage

This mod currently adds the `Pathing` object for the usage use in macros.  
It can be used in any language just like for example the `Player` object.

### Example

1st script; pathfind to the block targeted by the crosshair
```js
Player.setDrawPredictions(true);

// Set goal here
const goal = Player.rayTraceBlock(20, false).getBlockPos(); 
Chat.log("Goal: " + goal);

if (Pathing.pathTo(goal.getX(), goal.getY(), goal.getZ(), true)) {
    Pathing.visualizePath();
    var inputs = Pathing.getInputs();
    
    // In order to execute the inputs directly use this code
    // Player.predictInputs(inputs, true);
    // Player.addInputs(inputs);
    
    const file = FS.open("inputs.csv");
    file.write("movementForward,movementSideways,yaw,pitch,jumping,sneaking,sprinting\n")
    Chat.log("Saving inputs")
    for (const input of inputs) {  
        file.append(input.toString(false) + "\n")
    }
} else {
    Chat.log("No path found")
}
```

2nd script; execute inputs
```js
const PlayerInput = Java.type("xyz.wagyourtail.jsmacros.client.api.classes.PlayerInput")

Chat.log("Reading inputs from file")
let csv = FS.open("inputs.csv").read()
let inputs = PlayerInput.fromCsv(csv)
Player.addInputs(inputs)
```

## FAQ

### Does it work yet?

**NO**

### Why is it called UltraSonic?

It's the opposite of [baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone).  
And this mod's goal is it to be **Ultra** fast like **Sonic** from the video games.
