UltraSonic wants to be a pathing extension for the macros mod [JsMacros](https://github.com/wagyourtail/JsMacros).  
Currently only very simple 2d pathing is supported.

     or an old version of Minecraft.

   and move it to the mods folder (`.minecraft/mods`).
3. Download the newest [JsMacros release](https://github.com/wagyourtail/JsMacros/releases)

## Usage

This mod currently adds the `Pathing` object to use in macros.  
It can be used in any language just like for example the `Player` object.

### Example

```js
// Configure goal to be (10|40|20) and allow sprinting 
const algo = Pathing.pathTo(10, 40, 20, true)
// Find path (node will be the goal node)
let node = algo.createPath()
// Extract the path from the node
let path = algo.getPath(node)
// Visualize path
algo.visualizePath(path)
// Extract the inputs from the node
let inputs = algo.getInputs(node)
// Execute the inputs/path
Player.addInputs(inputs)
```

## FAQ

### Does it work yet?

**NO**

### Why is it called UltraSonic?

It's the opposite of [baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone).  
And this mod's goal is it to be **Ultra** fast like **Sonic** from the video games.
